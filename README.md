I am a performance-driven technology consultant at PwC Belgium. Having daily exposure to business processes and data modelling, client problem-solving and data analytics, I am capable of extracting valuable data that effectively drives improved business decisions.

Prior to joining PwC, I graduated from Louvain School of Management (double master's degree in Business Engineering and International Management - CEMS MIM). During the completion of my studies, I also secured a 12-week internship at a Dubai-based SME, for whom I successfully increased online engagement and client base.

When not working, one can find me dabbling in wind-surfing, skiing or traveling.
