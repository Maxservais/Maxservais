I am a performance-driven individual and a former technology consultant at PwC Belgium. I have built experience in data modelling, data management and implementing client solutions (e.g. Salesforce, Guidewire)

Prior to joining PwC, I graduated from Louvain School of Management (double master's degree in Business Engineering and International Management - CEMS MIM). During the completion of my studies, I also secured a 12-week internship at a Dubai-based SME, for whom I successfully increased online engagement and client base.
